Hey there, I'm Amelia! 👋🏻

I enjoy turning messy data into clear and decision-ready insights, from cleaning and EDA to dashboards and recommendations. <br> Currently sharpening my foundations in SQL, dashboard design, and end-to-end portfolio projects.

🛠 Tools I use: Python, SQL, Power BI/Tableau, Excel and R <br>
🧠 Statistics: EDA, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression basics

Stay tuned! Projects are on the way!😉
